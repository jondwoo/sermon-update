## Video Sermon Auto Upload

Python script to automate NLPC's video sermon uploads<br><br>
Note:
* The script starts from Jan 5, 2020 (ID: 40782442)
* CSV file will update automatically with the latest plan as its curr_id
* Initial run will take some time due to many API calls, but idea is that once database is populated starting from Jan 5, 2020, the script will only retrieve the latest week's sermon info 

TODO:
* implement database
